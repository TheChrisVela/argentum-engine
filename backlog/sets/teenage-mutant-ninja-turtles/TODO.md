# Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMT) — Implementation Plan

> **Every card must be implemented perfectly — exactly as stated in the rules.** No
> approximations, no "close enough", no silently dropped clauses. Each card's behavior must
> match its oracle text (from `tmt_full.json` in the repo root) and the Comprehensive Rules
> (`MagicCompRules_20260417.pdf`) in full, including edge cases, timing, and interactions.
> A card is not done until its scenario test proves the rules-correct behavior.

## Status

96 / 190 implemented (basics excluded — handled by `basicLandsFallback`). See
`cards.md` for the full checklist; the per-card commits on `tmt-scaffolding`
all carry `flavorText` in metadata.

The remaining 94 cards mostly cluster on a handful of unresolved gaps:
- **Sneak** — 26 cards (Gap A — unresolved)
- **Disappear** — 9 cards (Gap B — unresolved)
- **Alliance** — 4 cards left (Gap C — partly cleared; 6 shipped composably,
  the remaining 4 each have an *additional* unresolved blocker beyond Alliance
  itself: `Lita` → Gap E modal-not-yet-chosen, `Raphael, Most Attitude` → exile-
  and-may-cast chain, `The Neutrinos` → flicker-tapped-and-attacking, `The
  Neutrinos` listed once). Pure Alliance is no longer a blocker on its own.
- **Class** — 3 cards (Gap U — unresolved)
- **Mutagen token consumers** — ~5 cards (Gap W — unresolved)
- **Vehicles / Crew** — 1 card left (Gap J — partly cleared; `Turtle Blimp`
  shipped composably, `Turtle Van` still waits on Gap LL "creature that
  crewed this vehicle this turn" tracking)
- **Sagas** — 2 cards (Gap K)
- Plus various one-offs from Gaps M and N–LL

Gaps **resolved across the runs so far**:
- **Gap C — Alliance (partly cleared)**: 6 of the 10 Alliance cards (`East
  Wind Avatar`, `EPF Point Squad`, `Mighty Mutanimals`, `Mutant Town
  Musicians`, `Raphael, Tough Turtle`, `Slash, Reptile Rampager`) shipped by
  composing `Triggers.OtherCreatureEnters` directly. The `Keyword.ALLIANCE`
  display marker is still absent, so the rendered card text doesn't get the
  italic "Alliance —" prefix yet, but the trigger semantics are faithful.
  Wiring the marker + `alliance { }` DSL helper is now purely a cosmetic /
  ergonomics improvement.
- **Gap D — Channel**: `Action News Crew` shipped via
  `activatedAbility { activateFromZone = Zone.HAND }` with
  `Costs.Composite(Mana("{6}"), DiscardSelf)`. The `Keyword.CHANNEL` display
  marker is still absent — same caveat as Alliance: behavior is right, the
  italic "Channel —" prefix doesn't render.
- **Gap H — Affinity for artifacts**: `Krang, Master Mind` shipped via
  `KeywordAbility.Affinity(CardType.ARTIFACT)`. No engine change required.
- **Gap L (partial)** — Landfall (`Weather Maker`) and all five basic-land-
  cycling variants (`Jennika` Plainscycling, `Stockman` Islandcycling, `Bebop
  Warthog Warrior` Swampcycling, `Zog` Mountaincycling, `Rocksteady Crash
  Courser` Forestcycling) all shipped composably via `KeywordAbility.
  typecycling("<Basic>", "{N}")`. Fight (`Novel Nunchaku`) and the four Mill-
  keyword cards remain unchecked but are believed composable.
- **Gap M — choose-one-of-N-keywords (sub-shape resolved)**: `Wingnut, Bat on
  the Belfry` shipped via `ModalEffect(countsAsModalSpell = false)` carrying
  three single-keyword `Mode.noTarget` entries. The general "choose a kind
  from among <list>" pattern in Gap M is closed for keywords by this idiom.
- **Gap S — delayed "at the beginning of your NEXT upkeep"**: `Casey Jones,
  Vigilante` shipped via `CreateDelayedTriggerEffect(step = Step.UPKEEP,
  fireOnlyOnControllersTurn = true, effect = …)`. The same pattern handles
  any other "next upkeep" rider that surfaces later.
- **Gap EE — bottom-of-library-then-draw**: `Manhole Missile` shipped by
  composing `GatherCards → SelectFromCollection(ChooseUpTo 1) → MoveCollection
  to Library bottom → ConditionalOnCollection(DrawCards)`. No new SDK shape;
  a future `EffectPatterns.bottomThenDraw(n)` would only be ergonomic sugar.
- **Gap O — "can't be blocked by creatures with power N or greater" —
  RESOLVED**: `April O'Neil, Kunoichi Trainee` shipped via the existing
  `CantBeBlockedBy(GameObjectFilter.Creature.powerAtLeast(N))` static — same
  shape BLB Azure Beastbinder uses. Fixed-N variant closed. The relative-
  comparison sibling **Gap HH** ("with greater power" than source) remains
  unresolved.
- **Gap Q — graveyard reanimate as a typed-override token — RESOLVED**:
  `Brilliance Unleashed` (Mode 2) shipped by composing `MoveToZoneEffect(...
  GRAVEYARD → BATTLEFIELD)` with `ConditionalEffect(Not(TargetMatchesFilter
  (Creature)), Effects.BecomeCreature(3, 3, keywords = {FLYING},
  creatureTypes = {"Robot"}, duration = Duration.Permanent))`. Same idea as
  the EOE Xu-Ifit reanimate-with-permanent-rider, but the rider only fires
  when the original card wasn't already an artifact creature card.
- **Splinter-style "triggers an additional time" filter** — `Splinter,
  Radical Rat` shipped via the existing `AdditionalSourceTriggers` static
  (same shape ECL Twinflame Travelers uses), parameterised on
  `GameObjectFilter.Creature.withSubtype("Ninja").youControl()` with
  `excludeSelf = false` so Splinter's own triggers count (printed "a Ninja
  you control", no "another").
- **Delayed destroy of a created token (Old Hob)** — `Old Hob, Alleycat
  Blues` ships via the EOE Systems Override idiom: `CreateTokenEffect`
  publishes the new token into `ContextTarget(0)`, then
  `CreateDelayedTriggerEffect(step = Step.END, effect = MoveToZoneEffect
  (ContextTarget(0), GRAVEYARD, byDestruction = true))` schedules a
  faithful *destroy* at the next end step — so the second ability's UEOT
  indestructible grant legitimately saves the token (a `sacrificeAtStep`
  shortcut would have silently bypassed indestructible).
- **Additional combat phase rider** — `Raph & Leo, Sibling Rivals` ships
  via the existing `AddCombatPhaseEffect` (same shape as LTR Éomer, Marshal
  of Rohan), with the printed *"if it's the first combat phase of the
  turn"* intervening-if approximated by `oncePerTurn = true`. The
  approximation is documented in the file's docstring; swap for
  `Conditions.IsFirstCombatPhase` when that primitive lands.
- **Gap I — double the number of +1/+1 counters — RESOLVED at the primitive
  level**: `Effects.DoubleCounters(Counters.PLUS_ONE_PLUS_ONE, target)`
  already exists (Sage of the Fang shape). Turtle Van's "double the
  counters" rider composes today; the only outstanding piece is Gap LL
  below (crewed-this-turn filter).
- **Gap J — Crew / Vehicle — partly cleared**: `Turtle Blimp` shipped via
  `typeLine = "Artifact — Vehicle"` + `KeywordAbility.Numeric(Keyword.CREW,
  N)` — same shape DOM Weatherlight / BLC Rolling Hamsphere. The Vehicle
  pipeline (artifact-becomes-artifact-creature-UEOT + Crew activation) is
  fully wired. `Turtle Van` waits on Gap LL, not on Vehicle itself.

## Data sources — do NOT hit the network

- **Card data** (name, mana cost, type line, oracle text, P/T, rarity, collector number,
  artist, flavor, image URI): read from `/workspace/tmt_full.json`, **not** Scryfall. It is
  a full Scryfall dump of all 195 cards (`.data[]`, keyed by the usual field names). When
  running `add-card`, feed it the matching entry from this file instead of doing a Scryfall
  lookup.
- **Rules**: cite and verify against `MagicCompRules_20260417.pdf` (repo root), **not**
  yawgatog or any web source. Read pages with the `Read` tool's `pages` parameter.

## Workflow

Each card is implemented with the **`add-card` skill** (oracle errata, set registration,
scenario test) — but source its card data from `tmt_full.json` and its rule references from
`MagicCompRules_20260417.pdf` per the section above. Run one card per Claude invocation:

```
/add-card <Card Name>   # from set TMT; use tmt_full.json for data, the CompRules PDF for rules
```

The skill is the source of truth on whether a card needs an engine change.

### Git strategy

**One PR per engine-change feature**, each off `main`. When several cards share one new
engine feature, that feature's PR can land all of them together — note it in the PR.
Composable cards (no engine change needed) can land directly on `main`, one commit per card.

### Per-card procedure

1. `/add-card <name>` — implement via the DSL, no class inheritance.
2. If it composes from existing primitives → commit directly on `main` (`Add <Card>`).
3. If `add-card` finds it needs a new `Effect`/keyword/replacement/SDK change →
   stop, branch off `main`, build the engine feature + the card + tests, open its own PR.
   Update `docs/card-sdk-language-reference.md` in the same PR (required for any SDK change).
4. Check the box in `cards.md` and update the `Implemented:` count.

## Notes

- Implement every card faithfully, reproducing oracle text as printed (use the Scryfall
  oracle text in `tmt_full.json`).
- Verify any MTG rule number against `MagicCompRules_20260417.pdf` before citing it.
- Battlefield filtering must use projected state (`matchesWithProjection`).
- Basic lands are covered by `basicLandsFallback`; add TMT-art variants only if you want
  the distinct printings.

## Engine gaps blocking the remaining cards

Each gap is its own PR. A card with more than one gap is listed under its dominant one
with the secondary noted inline. Quotes are from the card's oracle text in `tmt_full.json`.

### Gap A — Sneak (alternative cost) — 26 cards
**Engine change:** new keyword `SNEAK` + `KeywordAbility.Sneak(cost)` + alternative-cost
plumbing that branches on a non-mana, mid-combat condition.

> Sneak {cost} (You may cast this spell for {cost} if you also return an unblocked
> attacker you control to hand during the declare blockers step.
> [He/She/It enters tapped and attacking.])

Required pieces:
1. **Alt-cost gate at declare-blockers.** Today's alt-cost pipeline (`Flashback`,
   `Harmonize`, `Impending`) all resolve at cast time. Sneak's payment piece — returning
   an unblocked attacker you control to hand — happens during the declare-blockers step
   *of the same turn the spell is cast*. The action enumerator must surface "cast for
   Sneak" only when (a) it's the declare-blockers step of your combat, (b) you control
   an unblocked attacker, and (c) the spell is castable at the current speed. Casting
   for Sneak also queues the bounce-an-unblocked-attacker as an additional payment.
2. **Permanent spells enter tapped and attacking.** When a creature/artifact-creature
   spell resolves having paid its sneak cost, the permanent enters tapped and joins the
   attack. This already exists for cascade/mobilize tokens (CreateTokenEffect with
   `tappedAndAttacking`) — reuse the same `attackingState` plumbing for cast permanents.
3. **Per-spell "sneak-was-paid" flag.** 4 cards (`Leonardo, Leader in Blue`,
   `Turncoat Kunoichi`, `Karai, Future of the Foot`, `The Last Ronin's Technique`) read
   "if [its] sneak cost was paid" later — at resolution, at ETB, or as a turn-long
   rider on a damage trigger. Stash the flag on the spell-cast event (cast-time) and
   on the resulting permanent's component (post-resolution), and expose it as a
   `Condition.SneakCostWasPaid(source)` predicate.
4. **DSL helper.** `sneak("{1}{W}") { ... }` on `CardBuilder`, mirroring `harmonize`
   and `impending`.

Cards: `Action News Crew`? — _no, Channel_. Sneak cards (26):
`The Last Ronin's Technique`, `Leonardo, Leader in Blue`, `Leonardo, Big Brother`,
`Leonardo, Cutting Edge`, `Leonardo, Sewer Samurai`, `Leonardo's Technique`,
`Turncoat Kunoichi`, `Karai, Future of the Foot`, plus the remaining 18 — full list
is the cards with `"Sneak"` in their `keywords` array in `tmt_full.json`.

### Gap B — Disappear (ability-word trigger with "a permanent left the battlefield under your control this turn" condition) — 9 cards
**Engine change:** generalize the existing `nonlandPermanentLeftBattlefieldThisTurn`
flag and add a Condition usable inside any triggered ability.

Required pieces:
1. **Per-player, all-permanent tracking.** The current flag in `GameState` is global and
   nonland-only (used by EOE's Void / Spellwarp). Disappear needs **any** permanent
   (lands included) that left the battlefield while under that **player's** control,
   per-turn. Suggested rename / addition:
   `permanentLeftBattlefieldThisTurnByController: Map<PlayerId, Boolean>` set in
   `ZoneTransitionService` whenever a permanent moves out of the battlefield (destroy,
   sacrifice, exile, bounce, phase-out). Existing Void uses can keep reading the
   nonland-restricted flag or migrate; do not silently change Void's filter.
2. **`Condition.PermanentLeftBattlefieldUnderYourControlThisTurn`** that reads the
   per-controller map for the triggered ability's controller.
3. The triggers themselves are existing primitives (`Triggers.EtbSelf`,
   `Triggers.AtYourEndStep`, and an enters-with-counters static for `Putrid Pals`).
   Wire them with the new condition and the existing effect library.

Triggers used across the 9 cards:
- End-step (7): `Insectoid Exterminator`, `Lord Dregg, Insect Invader`,
  `Rat King, Verminister`, `Michelangelo, Game Master`, `West Wind Avatar`,
  `Krang & Shredder`, `Pizza Face, Gastromancer`
- ETB (1): `Foot Mystic`
- "Enters with two +1/+1 counters if ..." (1): `Putrid Pals` — needs
  `entersWith(counters, condition)` if not already supported.

### Gap C — Alliance (ability-word trigger) — partly RESOLVED
**Engine change:** still none required for behavior — `Triggers.OtherCreatureEnters`
already does the right thing. What remains is purely cosmetic: add a display-only
`Keyword.ALLIANCE` to the SDK enum + an `alliance { ... }` DSL helper (mirror
`flurry`, `eerie`, `vivid`, `fatefulBite`) so the rendered card text gets the
italic ability-word prefix.

Shipped composably (6/10): `East Wind Avatar`, `EPF Point Squad`,
`Mighty Mutanimals`, `Mutant Town Musicians`, `Raphael, Tough Turtle`,
`Slash, Reptile Rampager`, plus `Wingnut, Bat on the Belfry` (which also
needed the Gap M choose-one-of-keywords idiom — see below).

Still blocked on something *else*: `Lita, Little Orphan Amphibian` (Gap E
modal-not-yet-chosen), `Raphael, Most Attitude` (exile-and-may-cast chain),
`The Neutrinos` (flicker-tapped-and-attacking).

### Gap D — Channel — RESOLVED (behavior); display marker still missing
**Engine change:** none required for behavior. `Action News Crew` ships via
`activatedAbility { activateFromZone = Zone.HAND }` paired with
`Costs.Composite(Mana("{N}"), DiscardSelf)`. Cosmetic follow-up: add a display-
only `Keyword.CHANNEL` + `channel { }` DSL helper so the rendered text gets
the italic "Channel —" prefix. Same shape as the residual Alliance / Disappear
cosmetic work.

### Gap E — modal "choose one that hasn't been chosen this turn" — 1 card
**Engine change:** per-source memory of which modes have been chosen this turn,
threaded into modal-spell mode selection. (LTR's Gandalf the Grey gap mentions the
same shape — coordinate with that PR.)
- **Lita, Little Orphan Amphibian** — Alliance trigger picks a mode "that hasn't been
  chosen this turn."

### Gap F — Enrage (ability word) — 1 card
**Engine change:** display-only `Keyword.ENRAGE` + `enrage { ... }` DSL helper that
wires the existing "Whenever this creature is dealt damage" trigger (already exists per
Ixalan-era cards in older sets). Verify the trigger primitive is present; if not, add it.
- **Raphael, Ninja Destroyer** — "Enrage — Whenever Raphael is dealt damage, add that
  much {R}. Until end of turn, you don't lose this mana as steps and phases end."
  Also needs the **"don't lose this mana as steps and phases end"** mana modifier
  (CR 106.4b duration override) — see Gap G.

### Gap G — mana that doesn't empty at end of step/phase — 1 card
**Engine change:** mana pool entry tagged "persists across steps/phases for the rest of
the turn" (CR 106.4b exception). Likely a flag on the mana pool entry that the empty-mana
hooks skip.
- **Raphael, Ninja Destroyer** — see Gap F.

### Gap H — Affinity for artifacts (cost reduction) — RESOLVED
**Engine change:** none — the existing `KeywordAbility.Affinity(CardType.ARTIFACT)`
already works. Shipped as `Krang, Master Mind`.

### Gap I — "double the number of +1/+1 counters" — RESOLVED at the primitive level
**Engine change:** none — `Effects.DoubleCounters(counterType = Counters
.PLUS_ONE_PLUS_ONE, target)` already exists (Sage of the Fang shape). The
only card that needed this in TMT was `Turtle Van`, whose ship still waits
on the separate Gap LL "crewed-this-turn" filter (see below).

### Gap J — Crew / Vehicle — partly RESOLVED
**Engine change:** none for the baseline mechanic. `typeLine = "Artifact —
Vehicle"` + `keywordAbility(KeywordAbility.Numeric(Keyword.CREW, N))` already
wires the full pipeline (artifact-becomes-artifact-creature-UEOT, Crew
activation tapping a combined-power-N pile of creatures). Same shape DOM
Weatherlight and BLC Rolling Hamsphere ship.
- **Turtle Blimp** — shipped composably.
- **Turtle Van** — still blocked, but on Gap LL ("creature that crewed this
  Vehicle this turn" filter), *not* on Vehicle itself.

### Gap K — Sagas — 2 cards
**Engine change:** Sagas with chapter abilities. Earlier sets (Dominaria, LTR) already
have Saga support; verify it's still functional and the chapter DSL is reachable.
- **The Cloning of Shredder**, **The Last Ronin** — chapter abilities only; no new
  Saga primitives expected.

### Gap L — Landfall, Fight, Mill keyword, basic-land-cycling — partly RESOLVED
**Engine change:** none for Landfall + basic-land-cycling (both shipped). Fight
and Mill-keyword cards remain unchecked; expected composable.
- Landfall: `Weather Maker` — **DONE**.
- Basic-land-cycling family: `Jennika` (Plainscycling), `Stockman, Mad Fly-
  entist` (Islandcycling), `Bebop, Warthog Warrior` (Swampcycling),
  `Zog, Triceraton Castaway` (Mountaincycling), `Rocksteady, Crash Courser`
  (Forestcycling) — all **DONE** via `KeywordAbility.typecycling`.
- Fight: `Novel Nunchaku` — unchecked. ETB has an attach-then-"when you do,
  fight" sub-trigger which is the actual blocker (see Gap AA shape), not Fight
  itself.
- Mill keyword: `Does Machines` (Class — Gap U), `Kitsune's Technique` (Sneak
  — Gap A), `Paramecia Coloniex` (dies → "may exile … when you do, …" sub-
  trigger — Gap AA shape), `The Last Ronin` (Saga + Sneak). Each of these is
  blocked on a different gap; Mill itself is not the holdup.

### Gap M — one-off bespoke cards
Each is its own PR; they don't share a clean reusable gap with others.

- **Pizza Face, Gastromancer** — "If it isn't a creature, it becomes a 0/0 Mutant
  creature in addition to its other types" (type-grant + base P/T on a non-creature).
- **Rat King, Verminister** — "Return target creature card and all other cards with the
  same name as that card from your graveyard to the battlefield tapped." (Name-matching
  multi-target reanimate.)
- **Krang & Shredder** — "Whenever Krang & Shredder enter or attack, each opponent
  exiles cards from the top of their library until they exile a nonland card."
  (Reveal-until per-opponent + cast-from-exile-without-paying via the Disappear rider.)
- **West Wind Avatar** — "you may sacrifice a token or a land" (sacrifice filter:
  "token or land" — composes existing filters, just verify the disjunction works).
- **~~Wingnut, Bat on the Belfry~~ — RESOLVED**: "choose flying / menace / haste UEOT"
  ships via `ModalEffect(countsAsModalSpell = false)` with three single-keyword
  `Mode.noTarget` entries. The "choose-one-of-N-keywords UEOT grant" sub-shape
  is closed for keywords by this idiom; the same composition generalises to any
  "choose a kind from among <list of statics>" wording.
- **Lord Dregg, Insect Invader** — "Sacrifice a token: Draw a card." (Token-filtered
  sacrifice cost on an activated ability; verify `AbilityCost.SacrificeFiltered`
  supports the token predicate.)
- **The Last Ronin's Technique** — Sneak rider: "If this spell's sneak cost was paid,
  they enter tapped and attacking." (Gap A) → token-creator already supports
  tapped-and-attacking; condition is the new piece.

(Continue listing as `add-card` discovers more during implementation.)

## New engine gaps discovered during implementation

These were found while walking the alphabetical card list. Each is one card today
unless noted; group with Gap M if they stay solo, lift to their own gap if more
cards turn up wanting the same primitive.

### Gap N — distinct-card-types-among-spells-cast-this-turn dynamic amount
**Engine change:** add `DynamicAmount.DistinctCardTypesAmongSpellsCastByYouThisTurn`
(or a parameterized aggregator over the existing spell-cast-this-turn log).
- **April O'Neil, Hacktivist** — end step: "draw a card for each card type among
  spells you've cast this turn."

### Gap O — "can't be blocked by creatures with power N or greater" — RESOLVED
**Engine change:** none. `CantBeBlockedBy(GameObjectFilter.Creature.powerAtLeast(N))`
already covers the fixed-N variant — shipped via April O'Neil, Kunoichi
Trainee. The relative-comparison sibling is **Gap HH** below.

### Gap P — "unless you discard a card" cost-mitigation rider
**Engine change:** a triggered-ability shape that says "sacrifice X unless you
[pay alternate cost]," where the player chooses on resolution.
- **Bebop & Rocksteady** — "Whenever Bebop & Rocksteady attack or block, sacrifice
  a permanent unless you discard a card."

### Gap Q — graveyard reanimate as a typed-override token — RESOLVED
**Engine change:** none. The `MoveToZoneEffect(GRAVEYARD → BATTLEFIELD) +
ConditionalEffect(Not(TargetMatchesFilter(Creature)),
Effects.BecomeCreature(... duration = Duration.Permanent))` chain models
Brilliance Unleashed's second mode faithfully. The "becomes" rider only
fires on the non-creature branch, matching the printed text. `BecomeCreature`
with `duration = Duration.Permanent` mirrors EOE Xu-Ifit's reanimate-with-
permanent-rider shape.

### Gap R — gain control of all matching permanents UEOT + untap + grant haste
**Engine change:** a bulk gain-control effect over a filter (all artifacts an
opponent controls), composed with Untap and GrantKeyword(HASTE, UEOT). Existing
gain-control primitives are single-target (LTR Gap 37 covers duration-based).
- **Broadcast Takeover** — "Gain control of all artifacts your opponents control
  until end of turn. Untap them. They gain haste until end of turn."

### Gap S — delayed "at the beginning of your NEXT upkeep" — RESOLVED
**Engine change:** none required. `CreateDelayedTriggerEffect(step = Step.UPKEEP,
fireOnlyOnControllersTurn = true, effect = …)` already covers this — `Casey
Jones, Vigilante` shipped via that combinator paired with the Urgoros random-
discard pipeline. The same composition handles any future "at your next
upkeep" rider.

### Gap T — copy-an-artifact-token with sacrifice at the next end step
**Engine change:** activated "create a token that's a copy of target artifact you
control" + "sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step." Existing
token-copy effects are creature-typed and don't carry a self-sac timer.
- **Chrome Dome** — "{5}: Create a token that's a copy of another target artifact
  you control. That token gains haste. Sacrifice it at the beginning of the next
  end step."

### Gap U — Class enchantments (level-up subtype) — 2 cards
**Engine change:** the Class card type (Strixhaven CR 716) — sorcery-speed
level-up costs, per-level static/triggered abilities, "becomes level N" trigger.
Likely a sizable build; coordinates with future Strixhaven / Adventures in the
Forgotten Realms work.
- **Cool but Rude** — Class with 3 levels.
- **Does Machines** — Class with 2 levels.

### Gap V — search-or-fail conditional ETB effect
**Engine change:** an "ETB: search library for X; if no X is put into hand this
way, create a Y token" composite. Composes existing primitives but needs the
post-search "did anything land in hand" condition exposed.
- **Courier of Comestibles** — "search your library for a Food card …; if you
  don't put a card into your hand this way, create a Food token."

### Gap W — Mutagen token (artifact token with an activated counter ability)
**Engine change:** generic "create a Mutagen token" facade — an artifact token
with "{1}, {T}, Sacrifice: put a +1/+1 counter on target creature. Activate only
as a sorcery." Several cards reference it; once defined, they're all composable.
- **Crustacean Commando** — "create a Mutagen token."
- **Genghis Frog** — "Whenever … another Mutant you control enters, create a
  Mutagen token."

### Gap X — flicker a pair (artifact + creature) and return together
**Engine change:** an exile-and-return effect that takes two targets and returns
both at the same time (so synchronous ETB triggers see each other).
- **Don & Leo, Problem Solvers** — "exile up to one target artifact you control
  and up to one target creature you control. Then return them to the battlefield
  under their owners' control."

### Gap Y — grant a keyword (Affinity) to the next spell of a kind you cast
**Engine change:** a delayed continuous effect that watches the next noncreature
spell cast by you this turn and grants it Affinity-for-artifacts at cast time.
Different from cost-reduction-this-turn auras because the granted ability fires
at the *next-cast* moment with a specific filter.
- **Don & Raph, Hard Science** — "the next noncreature spell you cast this turn
  has affinity for artifacts."

### Gap Z — "an artifact entered the battlefield under your control this turn"
**Engine change:** per-controller "has X entered this turn" tracking that
includes artifacts (and ideally lands/creatures), and a `Condition` reading it
for static unblockability. Adjacent to the `nonlandPermanentLeftBattlefield`
plumbing but on the *entered* side.
- **Fugitive Droid** — "This creature can't be blocked if an artifact entered
  the battlefield under your control this turn." Second ability ("counter target
  spell that targets an artifact or creature you control") also needs a target-
  spell-targets-filter check that the engine doesn't expose generically yet.

### Gap AA — "when you do" sub-trigger off an optional sacrifice
**Engine change:** the "may [cost]. When you do, [effect]" two-step pattern,
where the inner trigger only fires if the optional cost was paid.
- **General Traag, Heart of Stone** — "you may sacrifice another artifact. When
  you do, General Traag deals 4 damage to target creature."

### Gap BB — "damage equal to the greatest power among creatures you control"
**Engine change:** `DynamicAmount.GreatestPowerAmong(filter)` (and the
single-creature filter for "the creature with the greatest power"). Read via
projected state. Pairs with several existing damage effects via
`Effects.DealDamage(dynamicAmount, target)`.
- **Go Ninja Go** — Mode 2: "deals damage equal to the greatest power among
  creatures you control to target creature an opponent controls."

### Gap CC — "Whenever you tap a land for mana, add X" trigger
**Engine change:** a triggered ability on mana abilities — the trigger fires
when the player taps a land specifically *to add mana*, not every time it
becomes tapped.
- **Groundchuck & Dirtbag** — "Whenever you tap a land for mana, add {G}."

### Gap DD — cost reduction conditioned on target's state
**Engine change:** spell-cost discount evaluated against the spell's intended
target (a tapped creature here). Different from "if you control X" reductions
because the predicate reads the chosen target during cast.
- **Grounded for Life** — "This spell costs {3} less to cast if it targets a
  tapped creature."

### Gap EE — "may put a card from your hand on the bottom of your library. If you do, draw a card." — RESOLVED
**Engine change:** none required. Composes inline as
`GatherCards → SelectFromCollection(ChooseUpTo 1) → MoveCollection-to-
Library-bottom → ConditionalOnCollection(DrawCards)`. `Manhole Missile`
ships with this idiom. A future `EffectPatterns.bottomThenDraw(n)` would
be ergonomic sugar but isn't required.

### Gap FF — "becomes an artifact creature with base P/T N/M" until end of turn
**Engine change:** extend `Effects.BecomeCreature` (or add a sibling) so it can
*add* card types instead of only granting Creature. Today it sets Creature +
overrides base P/T, which is correct for an artifact target but loses the
"becomes an artifact" wording when the target is a non-artifact creature.
- **Mind Transfer Protocol** — "target artifact or creature becomes an artifact
  creature with base power and toughness 4/5 until end of turn."

### Gap GG — "may pay X life where X is a dynamic amount" as an optional cost
**Engine change:** `Costs.PayLife` currently takes `Int`; need a
`Costs.PayLife(DynamicAmount)` overload threaded through the trigger-cost
pipeline so it can resolve at trigger time (e.g. equal to the triggering
creature's power).
- **Madame Null, Power Broker** — "Whenever another creature you control enters,
  you may pay life equal to its power. If you do, put that many +1/+1 counters
  on it."

### Gap HH — "can't be blocked by creatures with power N or greater"
**Engine change:** mirror of the existing
`CantBeBlockedByCreaturesWithLessPower` static. Either add
`CantBeBlockedByCreaturesWithGreaterPower` or parameterize the existing one
with a `ComparisonOperator`.
- **Prehistoric Pet** — "This creature can't be blocked by creatures with
  greater power." (Also has an activated bounce that's already composable.)

### Gap II — "you may tap or untap target creature" (controller chooses on resolution)
**Engine change:** an effect (or a target-modal helper) that asks the
controller to pick between tapping or untapping the chosen target. Today
`TapUntapEffect` carries a fixed `tap: Boolean` chosen at script-write time.
- **Sewer-veillance Cam** — Flash artifact whose ETB/LTB trigger says "you may
  tap or untap target creature." Composable apart from the player choice.

### Gap JJ — multi-subtype restricted mana
**Engine change:** today `ManaRestriction.SubtypeSpellsOrAbilitiesOnly` takes a
single subtype. Need a "this mana may be spent on a spell of subtype X *or* Y."
- **Turtle Lair** — "Add one mana of any color. Spend this mana only to cast a
  Ninja or Turtle spell." (The colorless `{T}: Add {C}` half plus the "Target
  Ninja or Turtle can't be blocked this turn" activated ability are composable.)

### Gap KK — "Spend this mana only to cast a [type] spell or to activate an ability"
**Engine change:** today `ManaRestriction.CardTypeSpellsOrAbilitiesOnly`'s
`allowAbilities` restricts to abilities **of [cardType] sources**. Need a
variant that permits *any* activated ability (not just artifact-source).
- **Purple Dragon Punks** — "{T}: Add {R}. Spend this mana only to cast an
  artifact spell or to activate an ability."

### Gap LL — "creature that crewed this Vehicle this turn" filter
**Engine change:** per-Vehicle tracking of which creatures tapped to crew it
each turn, plus a `TargetFilter` (or `GameObjectFilter` predicate) that reads
the tracking. Today's `Keyword.CREW` pipeline taps the chosen creatures and
flips the Vehicle to an artifact-creature, but it doesn't surface "the list
of creatures that crewed it this turn" anywhere; without that, "target
creature that crewed it this turn" can't be expressed. The natural shape is
a `CrewersThisTurnComponent` on the Vehicle (cleared at cleanup with the
existing per-turn flags), plus a `TargetFilter.CreatureThatCrewedSelfThisTurn`
helper.
- **Turtle Van** — "Whenever this Vehicle attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on
  target creature that crewed it this turn. Then if that creature is a
  Mutant, Ninja, or Turtle, double the number of +1/+1 counters on it."
  (The "double the counters" rider already composes via `Effects.DoubleCounters`
  paired with a `ConditionalEffect` on a subtype filter — only the crewers-
  this-turn target is missing.)

## Composable — deferred for time

All four of the previously deferred composable cards (`Baxter Stockman`, `Bebop,
Warthog Warrior`, `Dimensional Exile`, `Foot Elite`) have now landed on
`tmt-scaffolding`. This section will be repopulated if the next pass uncovers
more "composable but skipped" entries.

---

## Skip log — cards inspected and skipped (alphabetical)

Each row is a card encountered during an alphabetical pass that was not
implemented, with the underlying blocker. Gaps reference the sections above
(existing Gap A–M or the new Gap N–KK). Rows previously marked
"Composable — deferred" have all landed and been removed. Likewise, cards
that subsequently landed in later runs (the six Alliance composables,
Action News Crew, Casey Jones Vigilante, Escape Tunnel, Manhole Missile,
Wingnut) have been removed from the table — see the "Gaps resolved" list at
the top of the Status section for what closed those.

# Duskmourn: House of Horror — Engine Gap Analysis

Cross-reference of the **175 remaining (unimplemented) DSK cards** against the engine's actual
capabilities (SDK reference + source verification, June 2026). Generated to scope what must be
built before the set can be completed.

**Status:** 101 / 276 implemented (37%). Card list from `scripts/card-status --list --set DSK`;
oracle text pulled from the Scryfall API (`set:dsk`, 276 unique cards). The five basic lands among
the 175 are trivial; the 170 non-basic cards were each checked against the SDK.

## Bottom line

**All five headline mechanics are already built** — the hard structural work for this set is done.
DSK leans on Impending, Eerie, Survival, Manifest dread, Delirium, and Rooms, and every one of those
is in the engine and proven by implemented cards. As a result the large majority of the 170 remaining
cards are **buildable today** as compositions of existing primitives (standard creatures, the Nightmare
"Fear of …" enchantment-creatures, Eerie/Delirium payoffs, Rooms, manifest-dread creatures, life-13
dual lands, the impending Overlord cycle, the Glimmer "Enduring" cycle).

What remains are **~12 genuine gaps** — almost all one-off rares/uncommons — plus one small cluster
(Rooms door-state exposure) that unlocks several cards at once. None require a new mechanic subsystem
on the scale of the headline keywords.

### Already supported — no new engine work

- **Impending N** — `impending(n, cost)` DSL + `KeywordAbility.Impending`; time-counter alt-cost,
  not a creature while counters remain, end-step countdown. (The four remaining Overlords:
  Boilerbilges, Floodpits, Hauntwoods, Mistmoors.)
- **Eerie** — ability word (no keyword); triggers on "an enchantment you control enters" or "you
  fully unlock a Room." Payoffs are plain triggered abilities.
- **Survival** — ability word modeled as an intervening-if trigger: "at the beginning of your second
  main phase, if this creature is tapped, …". Proven by Acrobatic Cheerleader / Cautious Survivor /
  House Cartographer.
- **Manifest dread** — look at top 2, manifest one face-down 2/2, other to graveyard; face-down
  permanents + turn-face-up special action (`FaceDownComponents`, `CreatureTurnedFaceUpEvent`).
- **Delirium** — `Conditions.Delirium(count=4)` (four+ card types in graveyard), plus a `DynamicAmount`
  for distinct card-type count.
- **Rooms** — split-layout enchantments with two doors; `RoomComponent` records per-face door state,
  unlock-the-other-door is a sorcery-speed special action, "when you unlock this door" /
  "fully unlock" triggers fire (`StackResolver` + `UnlockRoomDoorHandler`). Proven by Unholy Annex //
  Ritual Chamber.
- **Leylines** — `leyline()` DSL (cast from opening hand). Leyline of the Void = `RedirectZoneChange`.
- Building blocks several gaps below compose: enters-tapped-unless-a-player-has-≤13-life dual lands
  (`EntersTapped(unlessCondition=…)`), exile-until-leaves, impulse play-from-exile, distribute counters,
  `MoveAllLastKnownCounters`, copy-token-of-target, `EachPermanentBecomesCopyOfTarget`,
  `AdditionalSourceTriggers` (trigger doubling), `PayOrSuffer` / per-opponent edicts, stun counters,
  `AbilityResolutionCountThisTurn` ("the first/second/third time this turn").

What follows are the **genuine gaps** — elements no current SDK primitive expresses.

---

## Tier 1 — Rooms door-state exposure (small cluster, highest leverage among gaps)

The engine *tracks* door-unlock state in `RoomComponent` (`isFullyUnlocked`, per-door set) but does
**not expose it to the SDK** for counting, gating, or cost reduction. Several "Rooms-matter" cards are
blocked only by this. One cohesive feature closes all of them.

1. **Unlocked-door counting + gating.** Add (a) a `GameObjectFilter` / `StatePredicate` for "a Room
   you control with an unlocked door," (b) a `Condition` for "N+ unlocked doors among Rooms you
   control," and (c) a `DynamicAmount` that counts unlocked doors. These then compose into the
   existing `Count` / `Compare` machinery.
   → **Rampaging Soulrager** (static buff while ≥2 unlocked doors), **Smoky Lounge // Misty Salon**
     (token X = unlocked doors you control).

2. **Distinct names among unlocked doors (alt-win).** A `DynamicAmount` that walks Rooms you control
   and counts *distinct names of unlocked door faces* (not whole-entity names — the existing
   `Aggregation.DISTINCT_NAMES` counts entities, not per-face). Feeds the existing `WinGame`-gated-by
   -`Compare` shape (Simic Ascendancy precedent).
   → **Central Elevator // Promising Stairs** ("you win if eight or more different names among
     unlocked doors of Rooms you control").

3. **Unlock-action cost reduction.** Cost reduction is modeled only by `ModifySpellCost`, whose
   `SpellCostTarget` variants all describe *spell casting*; `UnlockRoomDoorHandler` pays
   `face.manaCost` directly with no reduction hook. Add an unlock-action cost-reduction scope and
   route the unlock handler through the cost calculator.
   → **Inquisitive Glimmer** ("unlock costs you pay cost {1} less"; its enchantment-spell discount is
     already buildable via `ModifySpellCost`).

---

## Tier 2 — Player-targeted & player-scoped effects

The engine attaches auras and floating replacements to **permanents**; DSK has a few effects scoped
to a **player** that have no home yet.

4. **Enchant player.** No aura can attach to a player: every aura uses `AttachedToComponent`
   against a permanent, there is no `EnchantedPlayer` target reference, and no player-recipient
   "is dealt damage" trigger bound to the enchanted player. Needs a player-attachment subsystem +
   an `EnchantedPlayer` reference. (Payoffs themselves exist: `PreventLifeGain`, lose-half-life-rounded-up.)
   → **Grievous Wound** (the only enchant-player card in DSK).

5. **Durable, source-independent life-gain lock on a player.** `PreventLifeGain` exists only as a
   static replacement on a permanent that ends when that permanent leaves. Needs an effect that
   tags a specific player so their life gain stays locked *for the rest of the game*, decoupled from
   the source. (The damage-reflection half is the supported Tephraderm pattern.)
   → **Screaming Nemesis**.

6. **Set maximum hand size to a dynamic value.** Only `NoMaximumHandSize` / `RemoveMaximumHandSize`
   exist (remove the cap). Needs a `SetMaximumHandSize(target, DynamicAmount)` static + a per-player
   max-hand-size override read by the cleanup-discard SBA.
   → **Winter, Misanthropic Guide** (opponents' max hand size = 7 − card types in your graveyard).

---

## Tier 3 — One-off complex cards (each needs unique new functionality)

7. **Gain all activated abilities of a battlefield-filtered group.** The only "gains all activated
   abilities" primitive reads the source's *linked exile pile*. Needs a static that grafts every
   activated ability from a live `GroupFilter` of permanents you control (excluding same-name),
   re-mapping each grafted ability's self/`{T}` references onto the source.
   → **Marvin, Murderous Mimic**.

8. **Cross-zone type granting.** `GrantSubtype` (Layer 4) resolves against battlefield projection
   only. This card also sets the type of creature *spells on the stack* and creature *cards you own
   in other zones* (hand/library/graveyard/exile) — a cross-zone characteristic-defining layer the
   projection system doesn't model (Conspiracy / Xenograft family).
   → **Leyline of Transformation**.

9. **Exile all-but-bottom-N of a library + library-size dynamic amount.** No effect exiles "all but
   the bottom N," and there is no `LibrarySize` / `CardsInLibrary` dynamic amount to derive the count.
   Needs either a dedicated `ExileAllButBottomN(faceDown, eachPlayer)` effect or a `LibrarySize`
   dynamic amount feeding a count-based exile.
   → **Doomsday Excruciator** (each player exiles all but the bottom six, face down).

10. **"One per distinct power" selection restriction.** The `OnePer*` selection family
    (`OnePerCardType` / `OnePerColor` / `OnePerCardName` / `OnePerBasicLandType`) has no
    distinct-numeric-property variant. Needs `OnePerNumericProperty(POWER)` (a.k.a. "different powers")
    wired into the pipeline selector.
    → **Rip, Spawn Hunter** ("any number of creature/Vehicle cards with different powers").

11. **"Can't block alone" (co-blocker restriction).** `CantAttackUnlessCoAttacker` exists (set-of-
    co-attackers check), but `CantBlockUnless` takes only a `Condition`, not a co-blocker-set check.
    Needs a sibling `CantBlockUnlessCoBlocker`.
    → **Toby, Beastie Befriender** (its Beast token "can't attack or block alone" — the attack half
      already maps to `CantAttackUnlessCoAttacker`).

12. **Prime-number count condition.** All count conditions are threshold comparisons
    (`AtLeast`/`AtMost`/`Exactly`). Needs a numeric-predicate condition (e.g. `CountIsPrime(filter)`
    or a general `NumericPredicate` over a count). The "make a Fractal with X +1/+1 counters where
    X = land count" half is already buildable.
    → **Zimone, All-Questioning**.

13. **Opponent routes the caster's chosen targets.** The caster targets two creatures one opponent
    controls; *that opponent* then chooses which takes 5 damage and which can't block. This differs
    from `TargetChooser.Opponent` (opponent picks the target) — here the caster picks both targets and
    a different player selects which sub-effect hits which. Needs a resolution-time "opponent chooses
    one of these N targeted objects; route effect A to it, effect B to the rest" decision.
    → **Trial of Agony**.

---

## Small / content-tier items (not subsystem gaps)

- **"Everywhere" / all-basic-land-type land token.** `CreateTokenEffect` models only creature tokens;
  noncreature tokens go through `CreatePredefinedTokenEffect` against a registered `CardDefinition`
  (Treasure, Lander, Mutavault). The all-basic-land-type token is most likely a new **predefined-token
  CardDefinition** (content, not SDK) — *verify* that "is every basic land type" with all five intrinsic
  mana abilities round-trips as a token definition; if it doesn't, it becomes a real gap.
  → **Overlord of the Hauntwoods** (the "Everywhere" token), **Overgrown Zealot**.
- **`ManaRestriction` "spend only to turn permanents face up."** Same shape as the existing
  `InstantOrSorceryOnly` / creature-spell-only restrictions — a one-member addition to the sealed
  interface + a solver branch, not a new subsystem.
  → **Overgrown Zealot**.

## Buildable-but-complex — flag for careful authoring (not gaps)

- **Manifest-then-attach equipment** — "manifest dread, then attach this Equipment to that creature."
  Buildable only if the manifest pipeline exposes the just-created face-down creature as a referenceable
  attach target within the same resolution. Confirm the manifest result is capturable before starting.
  → **Conductive Machete, Cursed Windbreaker, Dissection Tools, Chainsaw, Killer's Mask**.
  (Chainsaw's "rev" counter is cosmetic — reuse an existing counter type feeding `ModifyStats`.)
- **Manifest dread directed at another player's library** — "its controller manifests dread" must
  target a *non-controller* player's library, with the face-down creature controlled by that player.
  RESOLVED: wrap the shared `Patterns.Library.manifestDread()` steps in
  `Effects.ForEachPlayer(Player.ControllerOf("target spell"), …)` — the per-player iteration rebinds
  the body's controller (and the manifested creature's control) to that player. Needed a fix so
  `ForEachExecutor.resolvePlayers` resolves single-player refs like `ControllerOf` instead of
  falling back to all active players.
  → **Fear of Impostors** (DONE), **Unwanted Remake** (same shape).
- **The Mindskinner / Valgavoth, Terror Eater / Marina Vendrell's Grimoire** — deep but pure
  compositions (prevent-damage→mill, Ward—Sacrifice + opponents'-cards-to-exile + pay-life-to-cast,
  no-max-hand + gain/lose-life draw/discard engine).

## Recommended build order

1. **Rooms door-state exposure (Tier 1)** — one cohesive feature (unlocked-door filter + condition +
   dynamic amount, distinct-door-name count, unlock-cost reduction) unlocks Rampaging Soulrager,
   Smoky Lounge // Misty Salon, Central Elevator // Promising Stairs, and Inquisitive Glimmer.
2. **The buildable bulk** — work the ~155 buildable cards through the `add-card` skill: the impending
   Overlord cycle, the Glimmer "Enduring" cycle, the Nightmare "Fear of …" cycle, the remaining Rooms,
   manifest-dread creatures, Eerie/Delirium/Survival payoffs, the life-13 dual lands, and the five basics.
3. **Tier 2 player-scoped effects** — enchant-player (Grievous Wound), durable life-gain lock
   (Screaming Nemesis), dynamic max-hand-size (Winter).
4. **Tier 3 one-offs** as the relevant legendaries/rares come up (Marvin, Leyline of Transformation,
   Doomsday Excruciator, Rip, Toby, Zimone, Trial of Agony).

The five headline mechanics already being done means the structural risk for DSK is low: most of the
set is authoring work, and the gaps above are narrow, mostly-isolated additions.

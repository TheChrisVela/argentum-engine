/**
 * Tests for the Omen mechanic (Tarkir: Dragonstorm).
 *
 * An Omen card is a permanent (here a creature) whose [com.wingedsheep.sdk.model.CardLayout.OMEN]
 * `cardFaces[0]` is an instant/sorcery spell. Casting the Omen face (via [CastSpell.faceIndex] = 0)
 * is identical to casting an Adventure, but on resolution the card is **shuffled into its owner's
 * library** instead of being exiled with a cast-from-exile permission, and instead of going to the
 * graveyard like a normal spell.
 *
 * Modeled on Dirgur Island Dragon // Skimming Strike — the Omen draws a card and shuffles itself
 * back in. Here the Omen face is reduced to a plain "Draw a card" so the resolution behavior is
 * isolated from target selection.
 *
 * ## Covered scenarios
 * - Casting the Omen resolves the spell effect, then shuffles the card into the library.
 * - The card lands in the library (not graveyard, not exile).
 * - A [LibraryShuffledEvent] is emitted.
 * - The permanent (creature) face still casts normally to the battlefield.

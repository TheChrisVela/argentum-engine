 * Lifecycle tests for PlayerTurnHijackedComponent (PR 2A — engine mechanic only).
 *
 * Phase 2A delivers the turn-control component, scheduling, and end-of-turn cleanup.
 * Decision/action routing and the frontend visibility surface land in 2B/2C — the
 * engine simply tracks who's controlling whose turn here.

# Card SDK Language Reference

A complete catalog of every building block available to card authors in the Argentum
Engine `mtg-sdk`, with a one-line description for each. Designed to be scanned and
searched. For step-by-step authoring workflow see [`api-guide.md`](api-guide.md) and
[`adding-new-cards-workflow.md`](adding-new-cards-workflow.md); for hard cases see
[`managing-complex-and-rare-abilities.md`](managing-complex-and-rare-abilities.md).

**Maintenance rule:** this document is the canonical SDK catalog. **Every change to the
SDK — new effect, trigger, condition, filter, cost, keyword, dynamic amount, modal
shape, replacement effect, etc. — must update the matching section here in the same
change.** If the entry doesn't fit cleanly in an existing section, add or rename a
section; do not let SDK additions land without a corresponding doc update.

## 1. Top-level card DSL

**Entry points**

- `card("Name") { ... }` — open the builder for a standard card.
- `basicLand("Plains" | "Island" | "Swamp" | "Mountain" | "Forest")` — shortcut for basic lands (sets type line,
  intrinsic mana ability, supertype).

**Card builder properties**

- `manaCost: String` — mana cost in `{X}{R}{U}` syntax.
- `typeLine: String` — full type line including supertypes and subtypes.
- `oracleText: String` — rules text; auto-generated from abilities if omitted.
- `power: Int?`, `toughness: Int?` — base P/T for creatures.
- `dynamicPower`, `dynamicToughness` — characteristic-defining P/T (e.g. `*/*` Tarmogoyf).
- `dynamicStats(source, powerOffset?, toughnessOffset?)` — sets both with optional `±` deltas.
- `startingLoyalty: Int?` — starting loyalty for planeswalkers.
- `colorIdentity: String?` — override (normally auto-detected). Treated as authoritative in this repo.
- `auraTarget: TargetRequirement?` — what this Aura enchants.
- `morph: String?` — morph mana cost (cast face-down).
- `morphCost: PayCost?` — non-mana morph cost.
- `morphFaceUpEffect: Effect?` — effect that fires when this morph turns face up.
- `warp: String?` — Warp alt-cost; exiles at end of turn.
- `evoke: String?` — Evoke alt-cost; sacrifices on ETB.
- `selfAlternativeCost: SelfAlternativeCost?` — generic alternative-cost slot.
- `castTimeCreatureTypeChoice: CastTimeCreatureTypeSource?` — forces a creature-type choice at cast time.
- `cantBeCountered: Boolean` — spell is uncounterable.
- `conditionalFlash: Condition?` — gains flash while condition holds.
- `layout: CardLayout` — physical layout shape (see §2).

**Ability blocks inside `card { ... }`**

- `triggeredAbility { ... }` — "when/whenever/at" abilities.
- `staticAbility { ... }` — continuous effects.
- `activatedAbility { ... }` — `cost: effect` abilities.
- `loyaltyAbility(±N) { ... }` — planeswalker loyalty abilities.
- `replacementEffect { ... }` — "instead/if … would" replacement.
- `keywords(...)` / `keywordAbility(...)` / `keywordAbilities(...)` — add keyword abilities.
- `spell { ... }` — define the spell payload for instants/sorceries and Adventure faces.

---

## 2. Card faces, layouts, printings, set metadata

**`CardLayout`**

- `NORMAL` — standard single face (default).
- `SPLIT` — two or more halves on one card; combined characteristics apply off-battlefield (CR 709.4c). Used for Rooms,
  Fuse, Aftermath.
- `ADVENTURE` — primary face is a creature, `cardFaces[0]` is an instant/sorcery Adventure (CR 715). Resolving the
  Adventure exiles the card and grants permission to cast the creature from exile.

**`CardFace` (SPLIT / ADVENTURE)**

- `name` — face name.
- `manaCost` — face mana cost.
- `typeLine` — face type line.
- `script { ... }` — that face's abilities.
- `keywords` — face-local keywords.

**`metadata { ... }`**

- `rarity: Rarity` — `COMMON | UNCOMMON | RARE | MYTHIC | SPECIAL | BONUS`.
- `collectorNumber: String` — Scryfall collector number.
- `artist: String` — illustrator credit.
- `flavorText: String` — italicized flavor.
- `imageUri: String?` — art URL; auto-fetched from Scryfall if omitted.
- `scryfallId: String?` — Scryfall UUID.
- `releaseDate: String?` — `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `inBooster: Boolean` — appears in draft boosters (default `true`; `false` for Special Guests / starter exclusives).
- `oracleTextOverride: String?` — bypass auto-generated oracle text.

**Reprints** — add a `Printing` row in the new set's `Reprints.kt` and wire it into `MtgSet.printings`. Never duplicate
the `CardDefinition`.

## 6. Targets

### Resolution-time (`EffectTarget`)

- `EffectTarget.ContextTarget(i)` — i-th cast-time target.
- `EffectTarget.Controller` — controller of the source ability.
- `EffectTarget.Self` — the source permanent.
- `EffectTarget.TriggeringEntity` — the entity that caused the trigger to fire.
- `EffectTarget.PlayerRef(...)` — a player slot: `You`, `Each`, `Opponent`, etc.
- `EffectTarget.ContextProperty(key)` — value plumbed into `EffectContext` (damage amount, life gained, blight
  amount, …).
- `EnchantedCreature` / `EquippedCreature` — resolve via `AttachedToComponent`; requires the state-aware
  `resolveTarget(state, target)` overload.

### Cast-time (`Targets.*` / `TargetRequirement`)

- `Targets.Any` — any creature, player, or planeswalker.
- `Targets.Creature` — any creature.
- `Targets.Player` — any player.
- `Targets.Planeswalker` — any planeswalker.
- `Targets.Permanent` — any permanent.
- `Targets.NonlandPermanent` — any nonland permanent.
- `Targets.Artifact` — any artifact.
- `Targets.Enchantment` — any enchantment.
- `Targets.Land` — any land.
- `Targets.BasicLand` — any basic land.
- `Targets.Spell` — any spell on the stack.
- `Targets.Card` — any card in any zone (e.g. graveyard).
- `Targets.CreatureOrPlaneswalker` — combined.
- `Targets.TappedCreature` / `UntappedCreature` — state-restricted.
- `Targets.InstantOrSorcery` — instant-or-sorcery card.

**Chained predicates** — `.youControl()`, `.controlledByOpponent()`, `.opponent()`, `.withSubtype(...)`,
`.withKeyword(...)`, `.ofColor(...)`, `.tapped()`, `.untapped()`, `.power(n)`, `.minPower(n)`, `.maxPower(n)`; plus
`TargetFilter.excludeSelf` to exclude the source.

### Named multi-target binding

```kotlin
spell {
    val creature = target("creature", Targets.Creature)
    val player = target("player", Targets.Player)
    effect = Effects.Composite(
        Effects.Destroy(creature),
        Effects.DealDamage(3, player),
    )
}
```

For modal spells, prefer the explicit `targetPlayerControls(target)` DSL form; per-mode targets route via
`modeTargetsOrdered`.

---

## 7. Filters & predicates

### `GameObjectFilter` — for searches, sacrifice, group effects

- `Filters.AnyCard` — any card.
- `Filters.Creature` — any creature card.
- `Filters.Land` — any land card.
- `Filters.BasicLand` — any basic land.
- `Filters.PlainsCard` / `IslandCard` / `SwampCard` / `MountainCard` / `ForestCard` — specific basics.
- `Filters.Instant` — instant card.
- `Filters.Sorcery` — sorcery card.
- `Filters.Permanent` — permanent card.
- `Filters.NonlandPermanent` — nonland permanent.
- `Filters.WithSubtype(subtype)` — card of a given subtype.

**Chained predicates**

- `.youControl()` / `.controlledByOpponent()` — control predicate.
- `.withSubtype(s)` / `.withKeyword(k)` — type/ability predicate.
- `.ofColor(c)` / `.ofColors(set)` — color predicate.
- `.power(n)` / `.minPower(n)` / `.maxPower(n)` — P/T comparator.
- `.tapped()` / `.untapped()` — tap state.
- `.nontoken()` / `.token()` — token vs printed.
- `.faceDown()` — face-down state.
- `.card(filter)` — defer to a card-shape filter for off-battlefield checks.

**Explicit constructor**:
`GameObjectFilter(cardPredicates, controllerPredicate, colorPredicate, keywordPredicate, powerToughnessPredicate, subtypePredicate)`.

### `GroupFilter` — static-ability scope

- `GroupFilter.CreaturesYouControl` — your creatures.
- `GroupFilter.CreaturesOpponentControls` — their creatures.
- `GroupFilter.AllCreatures` — every creature on the battlefield.
- `GroupFilter.All(filter)` — custom group.
- Chained: `.withColor`, `.withoutColor`, `.withKeyword`, `.withoutKeyword`, `.withSubtype`, `.withoutSubtype`,
  `.minPower`, `.maxPower`, `.power`.

### `StatePredicate` — battlefield state checks

- `IsTapped` — currently tapped.
- `IsUntapped` — currently untapped.
- `IsAttacking` — declared as attacker this combat.
- `IsBlocking` — declared as blocker this combat.
- `IsFaceDown` — currently face-down.
- `HasCounter(type)` — has at least one counter of `type`.

### `AffectsFilter` — static-ability target shapes

- `OtherCreaturesWithSubtype` — lord scope (other creatures of subtype).
- `CreaturesWithCounter` — creatures with at least one counter (Aurification).

> **Load-bearing rule:** filtering battlefield permanents by type/subtype/color/keyword/P-T MUST use
`predicateEvaluator.matchesWithProjection(state, projected, ...)`. Use `projected.isCreature(entityId)` rather than
`cardComponent.typeLine.isCreature`. Non-battlefield zones may read base state.

    }
}
```

```kotlin
EntersWithChoice(
    ChoiceType.MODE,
    modeOptions = listOf(
        ModeOption(id = "khans", label = "Khans", description = "...", iconKey = "khans"),
        ModeOption(id = "dragons", label = "Dragons", description = "...", iconKey = "dragons"),
    ),
)
```

## 15. Replacement effects

```kotlin
replacementEffect {
    condition = Conditions.YouControl(Filters.Swamp)
    effect = ReplacementEffect.PreventDamage(1)
}
```

- `ReplacementEffect.IfYouDoBranchEffect(...)` — branch on "if you do" replacement.
- Custom — implement the `ReplacementEffect` interface directly.

Amount-modifying replacements expose **both** `multiplier` (×) and `modifier` (±) on the same type — do not split into
`DoubleX` + `ModifyXAmount`.

---

## 16. Counters

String-keyed counter types — resolve via the central `resolveCounterType` helper rather than per-executor character
substitution.

- `+1/+1`, `-1/-1` — power/toughness counters.

  `blood`, `cage`, `doom`, `storage`, `divinity`, `charm`, `music`, `crumble`, `corpse`, `germ`, `ink`, `growth`,
  `hour`, `energy`, `scry`, `aura`, `chapter`, `citation`, `rune`, `scar`, `crux`, `omen`, `secret` — assorted printed
  counter kinds.

Counter effects live in §4 (`AddCounters`, `RemoveCounters`, `Proliferate`, `MoveAllLastKnownCounters`, etc.).

---

## 17. Zones & movement

- `Triggers.TurnedFaceUp` — fires when source flips face-up.
- UI label: `"Turn Face-Up"` (used by E2E `selectAction("Turn Face-Up")`).

---

## 18. Components (set indirectly by effects)

### Permanent

- `ChosenModeComponent` — chosen entry mode (Sieges, modal permanents).
- `TypeLineOverrideComponent` — temporary type-line edits.
- `CountersComponent` — all counters on the permanent.
- `EnchantedCreatureComponent` — reference to attached creature (Auras).
- `EquippedCreatureComponent` — reference to equipped creature.
- `LinkedExileComponent` — linked exile pile attached to source.
- `ExileOnLeaveComponent` — replace next zone change with exile.
- `MayPlayFromExileComponent` — owner may play this from exile.
- `TappedStateComponent` — tap state.
- `FaceDownComponent` — face-down state.
- `ControllerComponent` — current controller.
- `ProtectionComponent` — protection from colors/types.
- `CantAttackComponent` / `CantBlockComponent` — combat restrictions.

### Player

- `PlayerCitysBlessingComponent` — you have City's Blessing.
- `SpellsCantBeCounteredComponent` — your matching spells can't be countered.
- `LifeGainedAmountThisTurnComponent` — accumulator for life gained.
- `LifeLostThisTurnComponent` — marker that you've lost life this turn.
- `PlayerAttackedThisTurnComponent` — marker that you've attacked this turn.

Card authors rarely reference these directly; they are created/updated by the matching effect or trigger.

---

## 19. Named-mechanic composites

- **Cycling / Typecycling / Basic landcycling** — `KeywordAbility.Cycling(cost)`, `Typecycling(type, cost)`,
  `BasicLandcycling(cost)`; unified via `TypecyclingVariant(cost, searchFilter, description)` in `TypecycleCardHandler`.
- **Adventure (CR 715)** — `layout = ADVENTURE` + `cardFaces[0]` Adventure spell; DSL:
  `card { adventure("Name") { spell { … } } }`.
- **Hideaway** — `Keyword.HIDEAWAY` (display) + `MoveCollectionEffect(faceDown = true, linkToSource = true)` +
  `CardSource.FromLinkedExile()`; no special engine plumbing needed.
- **Ascend / City's Blessing** — `Keyword.ASCEND` + `Effects.GainCitysBlessing()` + `Conditions.YouHaveCitysBlessing` /
  `SourceProjectionCondition.ControllerHasCitysBlessing` + `PlayerCitysBlessingComponent`.
- **Siege (named-mode entry)** — `EntersWithChoice(ChoiceType.MODE, modeOptions = ...)` + `SourceChosenModeIs("id")`.
- **Morph** — `morph = "{2}{U}"` (top-level) + `morphFaceUpEffect` for "as it turns face up".
- **Warp** — `warp = "{1}{R}"`; alt-cost that exiles end of turn.
- **Evoke** — `evoke = "{U}"`; pay alt cost, sacrifice on ETB.
- **Earthbend** — `Effects.Earthbend` composes AnimateLand + GrantKeyword + AddCounters + granted self-triggers (no fake
  keyword).
- **Forage** — `EffectPatterns.forage`; cast-from-graveyard permissions need a branch in `CastSpellHandler.validate`.
- **Blight X** — `AdditionalCost.BlightVariable` + `DynamicAmount.AdditionalCostBlightAmount` +
  `Conditions.BlightWasPaid(n)`.
- **Divvy (Fact-or-Fiction)** — `EffectPatterns.factOrFiction(...)`; `SplitPilesDecision` stays dormant until N > 2.
- **Astral Slide / delayed return** — `ExileUntilEndStepEffect` + `DelayedTriggeredAbility`.
- **Lord effects** — multiple `staticAbility { }` blocks + `ModifyStatsForCreatureGroup` /
  `AffectsFilter.OtherCreaturesWithSubtype`.
- **Player-scoped uncounterable grant** — `Effects.GrantSpellsCantBeCountered(target, filter, duration)` +
  `SpellsCantBeCounteredComponent`.
- **Static emblems** — `Effects.CreatePermanentEmblem(...)` for planeswalker emblems with static abilities.

---

## 20. Miscellaneous author-facing knobs

- `triggeredAbility { controlledByTriggeringEntityController = true }` — the triggered ability is controlled by the
  triggering entity's controller (not source's). Useful for ETB-on-creature triggers and Death Match-style shapes.
- `metadata.oracleTextOverride` — bypass auto-generated oracle text when needed.
- `metadata.inBooster = false` — Special Guests, starter exclusives, bonus sheets.
- `colorIdentity` override is authoritative — never run `:mtg-sets:syncColorIdentityFromDump`.
- Layer dependencies (CR 613.8) — same-layer effects sort by dependency (trial application) before falling back to
  timestamp.
- Server is authoritative; never compute legal actions in the client. Every state change emits a `GameEvent` so triggers
  and animations can react.

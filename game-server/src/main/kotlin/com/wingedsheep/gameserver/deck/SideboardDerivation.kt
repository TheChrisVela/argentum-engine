/**
 * Derives a Limited player's sideboard from their card pool (CR 100.4b):
 *
 * > "In limited play involving individual players, all cards in a player's card pool not included
 * > in their deck are in that player's sideboard."
 *
 * So there is no separate sideboard editor in Sealed/Draft — every opened or drafted card the
 * player didn't run is automatically their sideboard, and wish effects (Burning Wish, …) draw on
 * exactly that. The complement is computed server-side at deck-submission time (the only point the
 * full pool is in scope), counted by card name.
 *
 * Basic lands are excluded: they're an unlimited resource in Limited deckbuilding, not finite pool
 * cards, so "leftover" basics aren't meaningful sideboard material.

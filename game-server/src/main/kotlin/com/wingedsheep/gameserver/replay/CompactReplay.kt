/**
 * The compact, durable form of a recorded game.
 *
 * The engine is a pure, deterministic function `(GameState, GameAction) -> GameState` — and every
 * entity id it mints is drawn from a state-threaded counter (`e0`, `e1`, …), never a UUID — so a
 * whole game is reproducible from nothing more than the [setup] (which seeds [Format], decks, the
 * RNG seed, and the seat ids) plus the ordered list of [actions] that were applied. This is the
 * "record the inputs, re-simulate" approach used by deterministic game engines everywhere: we store
 * kilobytes of inputs instead of megabytes of per-frame snapshots, and re-derive the full
 * spectator stream on demand via [ReplayReconstructor].
 *
 * Replaces the old snapshot-plus-deltas-plus-full-states record, which kept an entire masked
 * spectator snapshot, a per-frame delta, AND a complete unmasked [com.wingedsheep.engine.state.GameState]
 * for every frame in memory.

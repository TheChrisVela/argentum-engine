 * Re-simulates a [CompactReplay] to regenerate exactly what was (or would have been) shown live.
 *
 * Because the engine is deterministic — same seed + same seat ids + same decks + same ordered
 * actions ⇒ byte-identical [GameState] sequence (entity ids included; the engine never mints a
 * UUID) — we can rebuild the initial state with [GameInitializer], fold the recorded actions
 * through [ActionProcessor], and run the *same* [SpectatorStateBuilder] / [SpectatorReplayDiffCalculator]
 * the live broadcast used. The result is the `{initialSnapshot, deltas}` shape the client's
 * `reconstructSnapshots()` already understands, and any single frame's full unmasked state for the
 * "share frame as scenario" path.
 *
 * Reconstruction is intentionally fault-tolerant: if an action ever fails to apply (e.g. a future
 * engine change makes an old recording diverge), we stop at the last good frame and log, rather
 * than losing the whole replay.

/**
 * Scenario test for Quantum Riddler (EOE) — {3}{U}{U} Creature — Sphinx, 4/6.
 *
 * "Flying
 *  When this creature enters, draw a card.
 *  As long as you have one or fewer cards in hand, if you would draw one or more cards,
 *  you draw that many cards plus one instead.
 *  Warp {1}{U}"
 *
 * Exercises the new [com.wingedsheep.sdk.scripting.ModifyDrawAmount] replacement:
 * the +1 modifier applies to draw events while the hand-size restriction holds and
 * does not apply once the restriction lifts.
 *
 * Verified by casting Quantum Riddler itself — once it resolves and its ETB
 * "draw a card" trigger goes on the stack, the modifier evaluates the hand size at
 * trigger-resolution time (after Riddler has left hand). With an otherwise empty hand,
 * the ETB-draw 1 becomes draw 2.

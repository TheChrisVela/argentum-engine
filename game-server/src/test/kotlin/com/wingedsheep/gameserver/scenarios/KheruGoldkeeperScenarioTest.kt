/**
 * Scenario test for Kheru Goldkeeper (TDM #199) — {1}{B}{G}{U} Dragon, 3/3, Flying.
 *
 * "Whenever one or more cards leave your graveyard during your turn, create a Treasure token."
 * "Renew — {2}{B}{G}{U}, Exile this card from your graveyard: Put two +1/+1 counters and a
 *  flying counter on target creature. Activate only as a sorcery."
 *
 * The leave-graveyard trigger is driven by activating *another* card's renew (Sagu Pummeler),
 * which exiles itself from the graveyard as part of its cost — a card leaving the controller's
 * graveyard during their turn — and Kheru's batching trigger then mints a Treasure. The second
 * test exercises Kheru's own renew payoff: two +1/+1 counters plus a flying counter (granting
 * Flying via projection), with Kheru exiled from the graveyard as part of the cost.

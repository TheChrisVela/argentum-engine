/**
 * Treasure tokens have "{T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color." They are
 * a legal mana source — a player who controls a Treasure can pay for a one-mana spell by
 * activating the Treasure first, then casting. The legal-actions enumerator must therefore
 * recognise the spell as affordable when the only available mana comes from Treasures.
 *
 * Previously, ManaSolver.findAvailableManaSources skipped any Composite cost whose
 * sub-costs included SacrificeSelf (the catch-all `else -> hasUnsupportedSubCost = true`
 * branch in the Composite handler), so `canPay` returned false and the cast spell was
 * omitted from legal actions. Auto-pay still avoids tapping Treasures — the player must
 * opt-in via ActivateAbility so the sacrifice is paid explicitly — but `canPay` now
 * counts Treasure-style mana toward affordability so the spell shows up as a legal cast.

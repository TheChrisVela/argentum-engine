/**
 * Scenario test for Gurmag Nightwatch (TDM) — {2/B}{2/G}{2/U} Creature — Human Ranger, 3/3.
 *
 * "When this creature enters, look at the top three cards of your library. You may put one of
 *  those cards back on top of your library. Put the rest into your graveyard."
 *
 * Exercises the look-at-top / select-one / bin-the-rest pipeline: of the three cards looked at,
 * the chosen one stays on top of the library and the other two go to the graveyard.

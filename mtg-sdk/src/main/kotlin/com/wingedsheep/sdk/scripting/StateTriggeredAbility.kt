/**
 * A state-triggered ability per CR 603.8: it triggers whenever its [condition] becomes true,
 * rather than in response to a [GameEvent].
 *
 * Per CR 603.8:
 * - The condition is checked each time a player would receive priority.
 * - When the condition becomes true the ability goes onto the stack as a normal triggered
 *   ability and resolves under stack rules.
 * - It does not trigger again while the condition stays true (the "latch"). The engine
 *   tracks this per (entityId, abilityId) via
 *   [com.wingedsheep.engine.state.components.battlefield.StateTriggerLatchesComponent]
 *   in the rules-engine module.
 *
 * Deliberate simplification vs the letter of CR 603.8: the printed rule resets once the
 * ability *leaves the stack* (resolves / is countered) and re-triggers if the condition is
 * still true. This engine instead resets the latch when the condition next evaluates
 * *false*. The two agree for every state trigger whose effect removes the source or clears
 * the condition (the only shape shipped so far — "sacrifice this creature" cards). They
 * diverge only for a state trigger that leaves both the source and the condition intact,
 * where the printed rule would re-fire each time it resolves; no such card exists yet.
 * Revisit (reset on leaves-the-stack) before authoring one.
 *
 * Authored on cards like Dandân ("When you control no Islands, sacrifice this creature"),
 * Force Bubble ("when there are four or more depletion counters on ~, sacrifice it"), etc.
 * Use the [com.wingedsheep.sdk.dsl.CardBuilder.stateTriggeredAbility] DSL block; don't
 * instantiate directly.

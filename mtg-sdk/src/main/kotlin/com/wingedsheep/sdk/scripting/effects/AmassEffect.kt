/**
 * "Amass [subtype] N" (CR 701.47).
 *
 * To amass Orcs N: if the controller doesn't control an Army creature, first create a 0/0 black
 * [subtype] Army creature token. Then they choose an Army they control, put N +1/+1 counters on it,
 * and — if it isn't already that subtype — it becomes that subtype in addition to its other types.
 *
 * The amount is a [DynamicAmount] so the keyword supports both the fixed printings ("amass Orcs 2")
 * and the variable ones ("amass Orcs X", e.g. Fall of Cair Andros, The Mouth of Sauron, Shagrat).

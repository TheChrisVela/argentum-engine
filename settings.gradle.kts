// an *exact* key match, so the populated (~50 MB) cache it saves on main is never restored — every run
// recompiles and retests everything from cold. When GRADLE_BUILD_CACHE_DIR is set (see .github/workflows/ci.yml),
// we point the build cache at a workspace path that ci.yml caches with a prefix-matched actions/cache key,
// giving real cross-commit reuse. Unset locally, so developer builds keep the default Gradle user-home cache.

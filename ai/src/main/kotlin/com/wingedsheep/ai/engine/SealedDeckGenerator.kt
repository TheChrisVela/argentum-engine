/**
 * Generates a 40-card sealed deck by opening 8 boosters from a set and
 * selecting a playable build from the resulting pool.
 *
 * The build itself comes from the Draftsim autobuilder ([DraftsimDeckBuildAdvisor]) — the same
 * archetype-aware, ratings-driven engine the deckbuild "Auto-build" button uses — so quick/AI games
 * get the same quality of automatic build as a human clicking Auto-build, backed by Draftsim's
 * per-set ratings/removal/archetype tables. The [buildHeuristicSealedDeck] color-and-curve heuristic
 * remains as a safety net for the rare pool Draftsim can't build from.
 *
 * Basic land names in the output are distributed across art variants
 * from the selected set.

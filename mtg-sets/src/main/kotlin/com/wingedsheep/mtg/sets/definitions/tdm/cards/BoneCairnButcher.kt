/**
 * Bone-Cairn Butcher — Tarkir: Dragonstorm #173
 * {1}{R}{W}{B} · Creature — Demon · 4/4
 *
 * Mobilize 2 (Whenever this creature attacks, create two tapped and attacking 1/1 red Warrior
 * creature tokens. Sacrifice them at the beginning of the next end step.)
 * Attacking tokens you control have deathtouch.
 *
 * The `mobilize(n)` builder helper adds the display-only "Mobilize 2" keyword ability plus the
 * attack-triggered ability that creates two tapped-and-attacking Warrior tokens and schedules
 * their sacrifice at the next end step. The deathtouch clause is a continuous static
 * [GrantKeyword] over the group of attacking tokens you control — since only creatures attack,
 * the group is constrained to creature tokens you control that are attacking, evaluated each time
 * the static is applied so the freshly mobilized Warriors gain deathtouch for that combat.

/**
 * Fractalize
 * {X}{U}
 * Instant
 *
 * Until end of turn, target creature becomes a green and blue Fractal with base power and toughness
 * each equal to X plus 1. (It loses all other colors and creature types.)
 *
 * One `BecomeCreature` (animate) transform on the target creature, until end of turn:
 *  - **base P/T** = `DynamicAmount.Add(XValue, Fixed(1))` — X plus 1, fed through the now-dynamic
 *    `BecomeCreatureEffect` power/toughness (evaluated once at resolution, CR 613.4c).
 *  - **creature types** set to exactly `{Fractal}` (Layer 4 set effect → loses all other creature
 *    types).
 *  - **colors** set to exactly green + blue (Layer 5 set effect → loses all other colors).
 * No keywords are granted. Cast with X = 0 it becomes a 1/1 Fractal.

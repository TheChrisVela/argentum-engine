/**
 * Terminal Velocity {4}{R}{R}
 * Sorcery
 *
 * You may put an artifact or creature card from your hand onto the battlefield. That
 * permanent gains haste, "When this permanent leaves the battlefield, it deals damage
 * equal to its mana value to each creature," and "At the beginning of your end step,
 * sacrifice this permanent."
 *
 * The two quoted clauses are granted as real [TriggeredAbility]s on the chosen permanent
 * (Duration.Permanent), not as delayed triggers anchored to the resolving sorcery. That
 * keeps them rules-faithful: the LTB damage reads the permanent's last-known mana value
 * via [EntityReference.Source], and the end-step sacrifice fires every "your end step"
 * for as long as the permanent persists (e.g. if the sacrifice trigger is countered, the
 * permanent keeps all three granted abilities — including the LTB clause).

/**
 * Mechan Shieldmate
 * {1}{U}
 * Artifact Creature — Robot Soldier
 *
 * Defender
 * As long as an artifact entered the battlefield under your control this turn, this creature
 * can attack as though it didn't have defender.
 *
 * Ruling (Scryfall, WotC 2025-07-25): once an artifact enters the battlefield under your
 * control, Mechan Shieldmate can attack that turn as though it didn't have defender — it
 * doesn't matter if that artifact stays an artifact or stays under your control. The
 * `PermanentTypeEnteredBattlefieldThisTurn` condition is a per-player ETB tracker (rather
 * than a "permanents you currently control" check), so the artifact may leave or change type
 * after entering and Mechan Shieldmate retains the ability to attack for the rest of the turn.

/**
 * Lobelia Sackville-Baggins
 * {2}{B}
 * Legendary Creature — Halfling Citizen
 * 2/3
 * Flash · Menace
 *
 * When Lobelia enters, exile target creature card from an opponent's graveyard that was
 * put there from the battlefield this turn, then create X Treasure tokens, where X is
 * the exiled card's power.
 *
 * Uses `StatePredicate.PutIntoGraveyardFromBattlefieldThisTurn` (LTR Gap 20) restricted
 * to an opponent's graveyard. The Treasure count reads `Target(0).Power`, which evaluates
 * against the exiled card's base power after it lands in the exile zone (the entity is
 * still queryable for its CardComponent base stats; Rule 400.7 doesn't strip CardComponent
 * on exile, and the targeted entity ID is preserved). Note: per oracle, "X is the exiled
 * card's power" reads the card's power at the moment X is calculated — the card has just
 * moved to exile but its base power is unchanged from its graveyard reading.
